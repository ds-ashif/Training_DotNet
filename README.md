# Training_DotNet

This repository contains my **day-wise .NET training work**, starting from the basics of C# and gradually moving into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts with hands-on practice.

## 📅 Day 1 – Day 3: C# Basics & Foundations in the folder HelloWorld

During the initial days (Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3), I focused on building a **strong foundation in C#**.  
The topics covered include:

- Basic C# syntax
- Variables and data types
- Control statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops
- Methods
- Basic console applications

As I progressed, I slowly transitioned into **OOP fundamentals**, especially:
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Understanding how real-world entities can be modeled using classes

The **`HelloWorldApp`** folder reflects this phase, where I practiced:
- Encapsulation
- Basic object-oriented structure
- Simple real-world examples using classes

## 📅 Day 4: Constructors & Encapsulation

On **Day 4**, I explored OOP concepts in more depth and applied them practically.

Key learnings:
- Constructors
- Constructor chaining
- Encapsulation in detail

All the practice programs and hands-on tasks related to these concepts can be found in the **`Day4`** folder.

## 📅 Day 5: Abstraction & Libraries

On **Day 5**, I moved into more advanced OOP concepts, mainly **Abstraction**.

What I learned:
- Abstract classes and methods
- Creating custom libraries
- Separating business logic into reusable components
- Using libraries inside a main application

As part of hands-on practice, I created:
- A custom **MathLib** library
- A **Calculator Application** that consumes this library

This work is available in the **`CalculatorAppDay5`** folder.

And so on....
